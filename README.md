In this Second Stage Submission, we have made the first customization of our application which is the "Register and Login" page. We integrate 
Java programming language with Firebase to manage the Realtime Database. First, the users should register their account through the register page, after the user has successfully
registered themselves to our application, then the data will be automatically recorded in Firebase Realtime Database.. Second, users should login in login page to access the homepage of our apps. 
Below are screenshots of each page :
